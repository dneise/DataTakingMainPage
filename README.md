# FACT - Data Taking Manual

 Print the [list of important phone numbers](https://trac.fact-project.org/wiki/Protected/ContactInfo).
 

## Before first shift:

Ask your nearest expert for a computer account in La Palma.

## On your shift:

 * Begin well in advance (1h), so in case of problems, you can call an expert and fix stuff.
 * open
  * [smartfact](https://www.fact-project.org/smartfact)
  * [the logfiles](http://www.fact-project.org/showlog)
  * [the weather](http://www.magic.iac.es/site/weather/index.html)
 * Check some things before you start:
  - [ ] Is [the weather](http://www.magic.iac.es/site/weather/index.html) ok to start?
  - [ ] Does [the telescope](http://fact-project.org/cam/index.php) look okay?
  - [ ] Does [the lid](http://fact-project.org/cam/lidcam.php) look okay?
  - [ ] Is [the container temperature](http://fact-project.org/smartfact/index.html?sound#temperature) lower than 40Â°C?
 * Create a [new logbook thread](https://www.fact-project.org/logbook/newthread.php?fid=2)
 
## In case of problems - No Problems

 First an foremost. You are a shifter, not an expert, so in case the automatic procedures fail
 and there is a problem, you might not be able to solve it.
 If you can't resume data taking, then park the telescope manually and go to bed.
 If you can't park, call an expert.

 If a problem occured, and you were able to solve it note the error message in the logbook and what you did to solve the problem.

 If the Main.js script throws an exception and stops ... note down the trace back and restart Main.js. Do not do this crazily often, if restarting does not help:
   * note that you shutdown early due to problems.
   * park the telescope and shutdown the bias voltage.
   * close the lid
   * maybe write a mail trough fact-online, so experts are really aware there is work for them.
   * go to bed
 
 * If you cannot close the lid: leave it open.
 * If you cannot shutdown the bias voltage: call an expert.
 * If you cannot park: call an expert.


## Startup via SmartFact

 1. Toggle Drive
 2. Unlock Drive
 3. Start Main.js 


## Stop via SmartFact

1. After successful automatic shutdown, simply shut off Main.js and fill out [the Checklist](http://fact-project.org/Checklist/)

2. If there was an exception during automatic shutdown, restarting Main.js sometimes does not help very much. Many experts are awake at this moment, so simply call them. If you want to deal with the situation yourself, you can try:

  * Park manually (drive must be powered and unlocked for this)
  * Close lid again (maybe open and close)
  * if parked, but the drive is not off, just toggle drive again.
  * then fill [the Checklist](http://fact-project.org/Checklist/)
