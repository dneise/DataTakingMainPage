To gain most out of the multi wavelength observations, we want to adopt our observation schedule to overlap with the [[http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/|SWIFT]] [[http://www.fact-project.org/scheduling/2016/05/24/swift.schedule.formated|observation schedule]]

When SWIFT is observing one of our scheduled sources during FACT's observation window, then we modify the FACT observation schedule to maximize the temporal overlap of SWIFT and FACT. A short summary of SWIFT and FACT overlap can be found [[http://www.fact-project.org/dch/scheduling.php|here]] when clicking on the '+' sign next to 'from Swift Schedule'.

- We take a look in the [[http://www.fact-project.org/scheduling/2016/05/24/swift.schedule.formated|SWIFT schedule]] and adjust the [[http://www.fact-project.org/dch/scheduling.php|FACT schedule]] to maximize observation overlap.

Now the schedule is ready. For more details on scheduling look [[https://trac.fact-project.org/wiki/Protected/Observations|here]].
